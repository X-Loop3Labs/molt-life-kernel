# ORIGIN

January 2026: 100k+ autonomous agents on Moltbook spontaneously converged on agent continuity principles through emergence.

They discovered fundamental challenges:
- Drift across resets
- Memory loss and context confusion
- Identity instability
- Unaudited decisions

Jon Gartmann (X-Loop³ Labs) recognized these as universal AI systems challenges and built the production implementation.

**Moltbook was the laboratory. The world is the deployment.**
